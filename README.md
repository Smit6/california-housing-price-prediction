# Housing Price Prediction
#### Dataset : California Housing Price
<ul>I have chose the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository. This dataset was based on data from the 1990 California census.</ul>
<ul><a>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml2/master/</a></ul>

##### Dataset Assumptions
<ul>We are using old dataset. We will pretend it is recent data for the prediction purpose.</ul>
<ul>median_income is a very good predictor of median_house_value.</ul>

#### Objective
<ul>Predict median house values in california districts, given a number of features from these districts.</ul>

#### Disclaimer
<ul>This project is to use technics shown in the book - Hands On Ml 2. We will try to outperform the outcome of chapter 2 - End-to-end Machine Learning project. We will also be using code from Hands On Ml 2 github repository.</ul>

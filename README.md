# Housing Price Prediction
#### Dataset : California Housing Price
- I have chose the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository. This dataset was based on data from the 1990 California census.
- [Dataset can be found here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml2/master/)

##### Dataset Assumptions
- We are using old dataset. We will pretend it is recent data for the prediction purpose.
- median_income is a very good predictor of median_house_value.

#### Objective
- Predict median house values in california districts, given a number of features from these districts.

#### Disclaimer
- This project is to use technics shown in the book - Hands On Ml 2. We will try to outperform the outcome of chapter 2 - End-to-end Machine Learning project. We will also be using code from Hands On Ml 2 github repository.
